Today, we were given a picture of a flowchart that explained the logic behind creating the game Hangman. At first glance, my reaction was like, "what the heck is this? because the flowchart looked complicated . However, as the challenge continued, I realized that the purpose was not only to understand the flow of logic but also to practice converting a visual plan into actual code. The task required us to take the flowchart and translate it into a Dart program.

The twist was that every five minutes, we had to swap locations and continue writing from someone else’s code. This meant that we weren’t just focused on our own logic but also had to quickly adapt to the way another person thought and wrote their code. It was both challenging and "fun" because it forced me to pay attention to how other people structured their work.

From this activity, I learned the importance of truly understanding the basics of programming and the flow of logic in any problem. Writing code is not just about making it work but also about making it readable and understandable for others. If the code is clear, then others can continue, maintain, or even improve it. This exercise showed me how collaboration and good coding practices go hand in hand.
